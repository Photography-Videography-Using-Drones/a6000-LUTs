# a6000-LUTs
Custom LUTs for the Sony a6000

LUTs are based on Portrait picture profile, set to -3 contrast, -3 saturation, -3 sharpness for the most log-like image possible. Test footage was shot with a color card, which was used with DaVinci Resolve to generate output LUTs.

There are 2 rec709 output LUTs, which are slight variations on one another
There are slog2 and slog3 output LUTs which emulate those respective profiles
Lastly there is the "vivid" LUT, which is a lightly modified film emulation LUT appropriate for the a6000
